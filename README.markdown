gerrymandering
==============

a visualization of the growth of safe seats in the u.s. house

built with d3

inspired by a chart on the [washington post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/10/07/want-to-know-why-the-government-is-shut-down-this-chart-explains-it/)

some inspiration also taken from a chart by [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/1127/)

data from the [federal election commission](http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/electionresults.shtml)
